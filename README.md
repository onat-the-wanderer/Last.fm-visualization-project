# Last.fm-visualization-project

### Introduction

The aim of the project is to visualize personalized data that provided from Last.fm user page. This project was performed by using Last.fm API to access artists, albums, tracks and tags of specisific user's scrobbles. The Python file currently extracts artists, scrobbles and tags thus it prints waffle chart of percentage of genres that you have been listen. However, some artist's tags cannot be scraped therefore, for now only 174 artists are taken as sample. The size should be changed for specific dataset but this problem will be sovled. Additionally, new graphs with different variables will be added. 

In order to access the data, API key must be obtained from https://www.last.fm/api
